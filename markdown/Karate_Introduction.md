## 🆚 Karate vs. REST-assured - A Detailed Comparison

For teams familiar with or currently using REST-assured, this section highlights the **key differences** between Karate and REST-assured, helping you evaluate Karate as an alternative. **If you prefer a pure Java API**, Karate provides that as well, with additional capabilities.

### **Key Differences**
| Feature | REST-assured | Karate |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **BDD Syntax** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **True DSL** | ❌ No (Fluent Interface) | ✅ Yes (Gherkin-based DSL) |
| **Implementation** | Java & Groovy | Java |
| **JsonPath Implementation** | Groovy GPath | JayWay JsonPath |
| **HTTP Client** | Apache 4.X (Deprecated APIs) | Pluggable, future-proof |
| **Test-Scripting Language** | Java | Karate-Script (Cucumber/Gherkin) |
| **Compilation Required** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Parallel Execution** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **WebSocket Support** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Mock API Support** | ❌ No (Requires WireMock) | ✅ Yes (Native API Mocks) |
| **Performance Testing** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Gatling Integration) |

📌 **Why Choose Karate Over REST-assured?**
- **Simpler Test Authoring**: Karate’s DSL eliminates Java verbosity.
- **Better Debugging & Reporting**: Step-through debugging & HTML reports.
- **More Powerful Assertions**: Deep JSON/XML comparisons.
- **Mocking & Performance Testing**: No need for WireMock or Gatling.
- **Supports UI & API Automation**: REST-assured is limited to API testing.
