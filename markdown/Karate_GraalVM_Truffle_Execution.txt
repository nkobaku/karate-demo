# Karate, GraalVM, Truffle & Polyglot API - Execution Flow Overview

## **Overview**

Karate is a **Java-based API testing framework** that allows scripting in **JavaScript** for advanced logic. However, since Java no longer includes a built-in JavaScript engine (Nashorn was removed in Java 15), Karate depends on **GraalVMâ€™s JavaScript Engine** for JavaScript execution.

- **GraalVM provides the JavaScript engine (`org.graalvm.js:js`)**.
- **Truffle optimizes JavaScript execution using AST and JIT**.
- **GraalVMâ€™s Polyglot API enables Java â†” JavaScript execution inside Karate**.

This document details **how JavaScript execution flows in Karate**, its **dependencies**, and **the role of GraalVM and Truffle** in optimizing the process.

## **What is GraalVM?**
GraalVM is a high-performance **runtime environment** that provides support for multiple programming languages, enabling them to run in the same runtime with **optimized execution**. It is designed to improve performance and interoperability between languages.

- **Provides a faster Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.**
- **Supports multiple languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, WebAssembly, and C/C++.**
- **Includes a Polyglot API for seamless cross-language execution.**
- **Enhances execution through the Truffle framework.**

ðŸ“Œ **GraalVM allows Karate to execute JavaScript seamlessly within Java-based test cases.**

---

## **What is JavaScript Engine?**
A **JavaScript Engine** is a program that **interprets and executes JavaScript code**. Since JavaScript is not a compiled language, it requires an engine to convert human-readable code into machine-readable instructions.

- **GraalVMâ€™s JavaScript Engine (`org.graalvm.js:js`)** provides JavaScript execution support.
- **It replaces Nashorn**, which was deprecated in Java 15.
- **It is built on Truffle**, meaning JavaScript execution is optimized dynamically.

ðŸ“Œ **Karate leverages GraalVMâ€™s JavaScript Engine to run JavaScript inside feature files.**

---

## **What is Truffle Framework?**
The **Truffle Framework** is an **execution framework** for implementing high-performance programming languages on GraalVM.

- **Uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) interpretation.**
- **Applies Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for performance optimization.**
- **Supports dynamic languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and R.**
- **Provides partial evaluation, reducing redundant computations.**

ðŸ“Œ **Karate benefits from Truffle as it optimizes JavaScript execution dynamically.**

---

## **What is Polyglot?**
Polyglot programming refers to the ability to use multiple programming languages within the same application or runtime environment. **GraalVMâ€™s Polyglot API** enables seamless interaction between different languages, making it possible to:

- Execute JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, and other languages inside a Java environment.
- Call functions from different languages within the same application.
- Share objects and data structures between languages without serialization overhead.

ðŸ“Œ **Example: Calling JavaScript from Java using GraalVMâ€™s Polyglot API**:
```java
try (Context context = Context.create()) {
    Value jsFunction = context.eval("js", "(x => x * 2)");
    int result = jsFunction.execute(10).asInt();
    System.out.println("Result: " + result); // Output: 20
}
```

GraalVMâ€™s Polyglot API allows Karate to **seamlessly execute JavaScript inside Java-based tests**, making it a powerful tool for dynamic scripting.

---

## **How Karate Depends on GraalVM?**
Karate requires **GraalVMâ€™s JavaScript Engine (`js`)** because Java no longer includes a built-in JavaScript engine. This engine is automatically included as a **Maven or Gradle dependency**, meaning that you do not need to install the full GraalVM distribution. 

- **Karate uses GraalVM only for JavaScript execution inside tests.**
- The **GraalVM JavaScript engine is included as a dependency** in Karate.
- **GraalVM replaces Nashorn**, providing faster JavaScript execution with **ES6+ support**.

## **Which Features in Karate Use Truffle?**
Truffle is an **execution framework for dynamic languages** and is used **inside GraalVMâ€™s JavaScript Engine**. Karate does not directly use Truffle but benefits from it in the following ways:

âœ… **Optimized execution of JavaScript functions inside Karate tests**.  
âœ… **Faster processing of inline JavaScript scripts for API validation**.  
âœ… **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation of frequently used JavaScript functions.**  

Truffle is **only used inside GraalVMâ€™s JavaScript Engine** to enhance performance, making JavaScript execution in Karate much faster.

---

## **ðŸš€ Complete Execution Flow (End-to-End)**
âœ… **Step 1:** Karate detects JavaScript execution inside a feature file.  
âœ… **Step 2:** GraalVMâ€™s JavaScript Engine (`js`) parses and executes JavaScript.  
âœ… **Step 3:** Truffle **optimizes execution using AST, JIT, and Partial Evaluation**.  
âœ… **Step 4:** GraalVMâ€™s Polyglot API **handles Java â†” JavaScript communication**.  
âœ… **Step 5:** The **execution result is returned** to Karate for test case validation.

## **ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways**
âœ” **Karate does not execute JavaScript directlyâ€”it delegates it to GraalVM.**  
âœ” **GraalVMâ€™s JavaScript Engine (`org.graalvm.js:js`) executes JavaScript in Karate.**  
âœ” **Truffle optimizes JavaScript execution using AST, JIT, and caching.**  
âœ” **GraalVMâ€™s Polyglot API manages Java â†” JavaScript execution seamlessly.**  
âœ” **Test results from JavaScript execution are returned to Karate for validation.**
