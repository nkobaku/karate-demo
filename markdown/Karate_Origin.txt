## Karate Origin

### Background
- Karate is an open-source test automation framework that unifies API testing, API performance testing, API mocks, and UI testing.
- It was created by **Peter Thomas** in December 2016 while he was part of the API platform leadership at Intuit.

### Challenges Faced
- Peter faced challenges with unstable automated tests for core accounting services, which were implemented in Java and relied on a complex, in-house framework.
- Despite his extensive Java experience, these tests were difficult to understand and maintain due to their complexity and scattered codebase.
- He identified an "impedance mismatch" between Java and web services, particularly in handling JSON data, leading to inefficiencies and incomplete test coverage.

### Insight and Solution
- Recognizing that JavaScript was more effective for working with JSON, Peter developed a prototype that interpreted concise, human-readable commands to interact with web services.
- This experiment led to the creation of a domain-specific language (DSL) tailored for HTTP, JSON, and XML interactions, resulting in the birth of the Karate framework.

### Key Milestones
- **December 2016**: Prototype development.
- **February 9, 2017**: Karate was publicly released as an open-source project.

### Growth and Adoption
- Early recognition by Joe Colantonio, a prominent test automation evangelist, boosted its visibility with a blog post and YouTube tutorial.

- Community interest surged, and Karate became widely adopted as a best-practice framework by teams worldwide.

### Establishment of Karate Labs
- In 2021, Peter Thomas and Kapil Bakshi co-founded **Karate Labs** to further develop the framework, improve open-source code, and build premium features.
- Karate Labs aims to make test automation simple, fast, and effective while encouraging community participation and trust.
