# RestAssured vs Karate: A Comprehensive Comparison

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed comparison between **RestAssured** and **Karate**, two popular frameworks used for API testing. The comparison covers various aspects such as implementation, syntax, extensibility, debugging, parallel execution, and built-in support for different features.

## Comparison Table

| **Runs on JVM** | Yes | Yes |
| **Implementation** | Java and Groovy | Java |
| **Code-base Size** | Large (~46,000 LOC) | Large (~50,000 LOC) |
| **Maturity** | Since 2010 | Since 2017 (Faster adoption) |
| **JsonPath Implementation** | Groovy GPath | JayWay JsonPath |
| **XPath Support** | Groovy GPath & XMLSlurper | Standard W3C XPath |
| **HTTP Client** | Apache 4.X | Pluggable, supports API mocks |
| **Quick Start** | No | Yes (Maven Archetype, ZIP release) |
| **Test-Scripting Language** | Java | Karate-Script (Cucumber/Gherkin) |
| **Test Compilation Required** | Yes | No (plain-text test cases) |
| **IDE Support** | IntelliJ & Eclipse | Partial (Cucumber plugins available) |
| **Step Through / Debugging** | Java + IDE | Better debugging, Visual Studio Code support |
| **Test Runner** | TestNG, JUnit | JUnit (optional) |
| **Built-in Tagging/Grouping** | No | Yes |
| **Extend with Custom Routines** | Java | JavaScript (no compilation needed) |
| **Deep Equals Validation** | No (requires external libraries) | Yes, supports JSON/XML/arrays |
| **Schema Validation** | JSON & XML Schema | RegEx & Macros (simpler and intuitive) |
| **Native JSON/XML Support** | No | Yes |
| **Data-driven Testing** | No (Requires TestNG) | Yes (CSV, JSON, Java interop) |
| **SOAP Support** | No | Yes |
| **HTTPS/SSL without Certificates** | Partial | Yes |
| **Environment Configuration** | No (requires dependency injection) | Yes (karate-config.js) |
| **File Upload / Multipart Support** | Partial (Buggy) | Yes |
| **Authentication Schemes** | Yes | Pluggable via JavaScript |
| **Parallel Execution** | No | Yes (core feature) |
| **Floating Point Precision** | Requires explicit float conversion | Auto BigDecimal conversion |
| **Built-in Reporting** | No (depends on TestNG, JUnit) | Yes (HTML & JSON reports) |
| **API Mocking / Test Doubles** | No (requires Wiremock) | Yes (built-in API mock server) |
| **Performance Testing** | No | Yes (via Gatling integration) |
| **WebSockets Support** | No | Yes |
| **Asynchronous Testing** | No | Yes |
| **Retry Support** | No (requires custom logic) | Yes (built-in) |
| **CSV/YAML File Support** | No | Yes |
| **Web UI Automation** | No | Yes (via Chrome/CDP, WebDriver, Appium, Playwright) |
| **Distributed Testing** | No | Yes (multi-node execution) |

## Summary
### **When to Use RestAssured?**
- Best suited for **Java developers** comfortable with writing API tests in Java.
- Supports fluent assertions but lacks true DSL capabilities.
- Requires additional setup for parallel execution, environment configuration, and deep validation.
- **Not ideal** for non-programmers or testers unfamiliar with Java.

### **When to Use Karate?**
- Best suited for teams who want **ease of use** with **minimal Java dependency**.
- Provides a **true DSL** for API testing, making it **more readable** and **less verbose** than RestAssured.
- Supports **parallel execution, API mocks, UI automation, performance testing, and WebSockets** out of the box.
- Ideal for teams looking for a **unified framework** for API, performance, and UI testing.

## Conclusion
If your team primarily works with Java and prefers using a fluent interface, **RestAssured** is a solid choice. However, if you are looking for a **more versatile and feature-rich framework** that supports API testing, performance testing, UI automation, and API mocks all in one package, then **Karate** is the better choice.
