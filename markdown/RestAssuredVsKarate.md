## Overview

| Feature | REST-assured | Karate |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **BDD Syntax** | Yes | Yes |
| **True DSL** | No (Fluent Interface) | Yes |
| **Runs on JVM** | Yes | Yes |
| **Implementation** | Java & Groovy | Java |
| **Code-base Size** | Large (~46,000 LOC) | Large (~50,000 LOC) |
| **Inception Year** | 2010 | 2017 |
| **Community Adoption** | Mature but slower adoption | Rapid adoption |
| **Test-Scripting Language** | Java | Karate-Script (Cucumber/Gherkin) |
| **Requires Java Knowledge** | Yes | No |
| **Test Scripts Need Compilation** | Yes | No |
| **Parallel Execution** | No | Yes |

## Feature Comparison

### **Syntax and Usability**
- REST-assured uses a **fluent interface**, which is more Java-centric but can become complex.
- Karate is a **true DSL**, making it simpler and more readable for non-developers.
- Karate supports **Cucumber/Gherkin syntax**, allowing natural language test writing.

### **Test Execution**
- REST-assured requires a test runner like **JUnit or TestNG**.
- Karate has a **built-in test runner** and supports **parallel execution** natively.

### **Assertion and Validation**
- REST-assured depends on external libraries like **Hamcrest** for assertions.
- Karate supports **native deep-equals assertion** for JSON, XML, and arrays.
- Karate allows **schema validation using regex and macros**.

### **Data-Driven Testing**
- REST-assured requires **TestNG or external frameworks**.
- Karate provides **built-in support** for dynamic JSON and CSV as data sources.

### **Mocking and Performance Testing**
- REST-assured does not support **mocking**.
- Karate includes **API mocks** and can **reuse tests for performance testing** with **Gatling**.

### **Environment Configuration**
- REST-assured requires **custom property file handling**.
- Karate has a **built-in configuration system**.

### **WebSockets and Async Support**
- REST-assured lacks **WebSockets** and **async support**.
- Karate supports **WebSockets, async/await, and retry mechanisms**.

### **Web UI Testing**
- REST-assured is **API-focused**.
- Karate supports **Web UI automation with Chrome/CDP, WebDriver, Appium, and Playwright**.

## Conclusion

**Why Choose Karate?**
- True **DSL** with **simpler syntax**.
- **No Java knowledge** required for writing tests.
- **Parallel execution** and **built-in test runner**.
- **WebSockets, Web UI automation, and async support**.
- **Better JSON, XML, and schema validation features**.
- **Supports mocking and performance testing** natively.

**Why Choose REST-assured?**
- More control for **Java developers**.
- Strong support for **custom Java-based test extensions**.
- **Better IDE support** for Java developers.

Karate offers a **more feature-complete and easier-to-use framework**, especially for teams focusing on **API testing, mocking, and performance testing**. REST-assured is better suited for **Java developers** who need tighter integration with existing Java codebases.
